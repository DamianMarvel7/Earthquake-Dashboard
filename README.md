# Earthquake-Dashboard

The Indonesia earthquake dashboard is an interactive web application that provides information about earthquakes history that occur in Indonesia. The dashboard uses data to display the location, magnitude, and time it occur. Users can filter the earthquakes by time, and view additional details about each earthquake by hover to the plot. The dashboard also includes a summary of the most recent earthquakes and a graph of earthquake frequency over time. The goal of the dashboard is to help people stay informed about earthquake activity in Indonesia and take necessary precautions to stay safe.

After creating two earthquake dashboards, one using Plotly and the other using Power BI, I have found that Plotly provides more customizable plots, such as density maps, that are better than those offered by Power BI. Additionally, Plotly allows for dropdown menus to visualize different plots based on city/province, which is a useful feature. However, I found that Power BI was able to generate the dashboard much faster than Plotly. Therefore, if you only need to create simple plots, I would recommend using Power BI.
